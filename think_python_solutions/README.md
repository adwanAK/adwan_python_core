## Note
These solutions refer to an older version of the _Think Python_ book
that used Python 2.7. Therefore you will encounter some differences between
your code and this code. Especially annoying: Some of the Exercise numbers
do not align...

However, it can still be a help to get a hint on how
to proceed, and you anyways shouldn't copy-paste any code but think through
it yourself. :)

## Tip!
Push your own solutions up to GitHub and maybe it'll become a repository
that other learners will refer to when working through the Python 3 version
of the _Think Python_ book!

### Think Python 2e
There's another GitHub repo with some solutions for the 2nd edition (the one we're
working with) by **MadCarlz**: [https://github.com/MadCzarls/Think-Python-2e---my-solutions](https://github.com/MadCzarls/Think-Python-2e---my-solutions). Check it out for inspiration!
