Exercise 3.3.
Note:  This exercise should be done using only the statements and other features we
have learned so far.

1.  Write a function that draws a grid like the following:

    + - - - - + - - - - +
    |         |         |
    |         |         |
    |         |         |
    |         |         |
    + - - - - + - - - - +
    |         |         |
    |         |         |
    |         |         |
    |         |         |
    + - - - - + - - - - +

    Hint: to print more than one value on a line, you can print a comma-separated
    sequence of values:

    print('+', '-')

    By default, print advances to the next line, but you can override that behavior
    and put a space at the end, like this:

    print('+', end=' ')
    print('-')

    The output of these statements is '+ -'.
    A print statement with no argument ends the current line and goes to the next line.

2.  Write a function that draws a similar grid with four rows and four columns.
