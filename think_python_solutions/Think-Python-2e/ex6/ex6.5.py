Exercise 6.5.
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides
both of them with no remainder.

One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation that
if r is the remainder when a is divided by b, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r).
As a base case, we can use gcd (a, 0) = a.

Write a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b and returns their
greatest common divisor.

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
