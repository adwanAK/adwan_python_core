Exercise 7.3.
The mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan found an infinite series that can be used to
generate a numerical approximation of 1/pi.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Rapidly_convergent_series

Write a function called estimate_pi that uses this formula to compute and return
an estimate of pi. It should use a while loop to compute terms of the summation
until the last term is smaller than 1e-15 (which is Python notation for 10**-15).
You can check the result by comparing it to math.pi.
