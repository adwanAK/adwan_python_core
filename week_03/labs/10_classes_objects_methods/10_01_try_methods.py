Read the documentation of the string methods at:
http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.
You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you
understand how they work. strip and replace are particularly useful.

The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing.
For example, in find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate
optional arguments. So sub is required, but start is optional, and if
you include start, then end is optional.

Demonstrate below:
- strip
- replace
- find
