1 - What is a string?
    A string is group of characters and a character can be any number, character or symbol.

2 - What is an index?
    It is position of the character.

3 - What letter will the following code print? Why?

    word = 'hello'
    index_two = word[2]
    print index_two
        It will print the letter "l" because we go pass index 0,1 to 2.

4 - What is the len() functions used for?
    To return lenth of the string

5 - How can you get the last character of a word using the len() function?
    word = "something"
    word_length = leng(word)
    last_character = word[word_length-1]

6 - What is string slicing and how does it work?
    Slicing takes part of a string or split it in how many ways we specify.

7 - How to do slice the string "python" to produce the string "thon"?
    _string ="pythong"
    _string[2:6]

8 - How can you use slicing to store the first and last character of a word in separate variables?
    first_char= _string[0]
    last_char= _string[len(word)-1]

9 - What are the answers to Exercise 8.4 (p.96) from the textbook?
def any_lowercase1(s):
    for c in s:
        if c.islower():
            return True
        else:
            return False
# any_lowercase1() will return on first character which doesn't produce what we want


def any_lowercase2(s):
    for c in s:
        if 'c'.islower():
            return 'True'
        else:
            return 'False'
# any_lowercase2() will only evaluate the letter 'c' not the parameter we are passing


def any_lowercase3(s):
    for c in s:
        flag = c.islower()
    return flag
# any_lowercase3() will run through the whole string and return on last character value only.


def any_lowercase4(s):
    flag = False
    for c in s:
        flag = flag or c.islower()
    return flag
# This one works and I do not know why. I have to ask instructor

def any_lowercase5(s):
    for c in s:
        if not c.islower():
            return False
    return True
# any_lowercase5() Not doing what we want.
# Checks every letter if it is not lowercased and returns boolean if all the
    # letters in string are lowercased or not;

10 - Can you change one or more character of a string? Why or why not?
    No. You cannot change it because it is immutable.

11 - What is invocation?
    A statement that calls a method.


12 - How do you invoke the find() method on the string word with the value 'hello' to find the index of the letter e?
    wrod = "hello"
    index = word.find("e")

13 - Complete Exercise 8.5 (p.96) (Caesar cypher) from the textbook.


14 - Follow the directions for Exercise 8.1 (p.79) until you feel comfortable with the string methods and what methods are available.

15 - How is the in operator used?
    if e in "hello"
