You’ll see that it creates a dictionary that maps from a sorted string
of letters to the list of words that can be spelled with those letters.
For example, 'opst' maps to the list:
['opts', 'post', 'pots', 'spot', 'stop', 'tops'].

Write a module that imports anagram_sets and provides two new functions:
store_anagrams should store the anagram dictionary in a “shelf”;
read_anagrams should look up a word and return a list of its anagrams.
