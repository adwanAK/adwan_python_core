2 - How do you create a list?
    _list = []
    _list2 = list()

3 - How do you nest a list?

    t2 = [3, 4]
    t3 = t1 + t2

21 - What is one reason it is important to know the difference between the two kinds of operations above?
    Because the first one if not done properly will cause error. Also, values of existing variable are changed.
